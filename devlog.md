# BurnStop Development Logs - Content Management

ðŸŽ‰ **AUTOMATED SYSTEM ENABLED!** ðŸŽ‰

Your devlogs are now automatically updated! The website reads directly from markdown files, so changes appear instantly.

## ðŸš€ How to Add New Devlogs

1. **Create a new file** in `src/content/devlogs/` folder
2. **Name it with a number prefix** (e.g., `05-new-feature.md`)
3. **Use the template below**
4. **Save the file** - changes appear automatically! âœ¨

## ðŸ“„ Template for New Entries

Create a new `.md` file in `src/content/devlogs/` with this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Devlog Title"
date: "Month Year"
status: "completed" | "in-progress" | "planned"
description: "Brief description of what this devlog covers"
progress:
  - task: "Task description"
    status: "completed" | "in-progress" | "planned"
  - task: "Another task"
    status: "completed" | "in-progress" | "planned"
---

Optional additional content here. This appears below the progress list.
You can write multiple paragraphs and use markdown formatting.
```
